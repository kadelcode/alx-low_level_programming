# ALX C-Programming
## A repository for all c programming tasks.
- [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor): A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file
- [1-compiler](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler): A script that compiles a C file but does not link. The file name is saved in $CFILE variable which extension(.o)
- [2-assembler](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler): A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension(.s) instead of (.c)
- [3-name](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name): A script that compiles a C file and creates and executable named (cisfun). The file name will be saved in the variable ($CFILE)
- [4-puts.c](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c):  A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line
- [5-printf.c](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c): C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line
- [6-size.c](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c): C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- [100-intel](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel): A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
- [101-quote.c](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c): C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error
