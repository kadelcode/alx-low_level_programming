### [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)
  - A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
  - Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
  - The two digits must be different
  - 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
  - Print only the smallest combination of two digits
  - Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits

  - Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
  - The three digits must be different
  - 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
  - Print only the smallest combination of three digits
  - Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
  - You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)

### [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/kadelcode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c)
  - A program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
  - The numbers should range from 0 to 99
  - The two numbers should be separated by a space
  - All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
  - The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
  - The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
